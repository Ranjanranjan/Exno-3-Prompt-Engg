### Aim:
To compare the performance, user experience, and response quality of different AI platforms (ChatGPT, Claude, Bard, Cohere Command, and Meta) within a specific use case, such as summarizing text or answering technical questions. Generate a Prompt based output using different Prompting tools of 2024.

### Algorithm:
Define the Use Case:
Select a specific task for evaluation across platforms (e.g., summarizing a document, answering a technical question, or generating a creative story / Code).
Ensure the use case is applicable to all platforms and will allow for comparison across response quality, accuracy, and depth.
Create a Set of Prompts:
Prepare a uniform set of prompts that align with the chosen use case.
Each prompt should be clear and precise, ensuring that all platforms are evaluated using the same input.
Consider multiple prompts to capture the versatility of each platform in handling different aspects of the use case.
Run the Experiment on Each AI Platform:
Input the prompts into each AI tool (ChatGPT, Claude, Bard, Cohere Command, and Meta) and gather the responses.
Ensure the same conditions are applied for each platform, such as input format, time to respond, and prompt delivery.
Record response times, ease of interaction with the platform, and any technical issues encountered.
Evaluate Response Quality:
Assess each platform’s responses using the following criteria: Accuracy,Clarity,Depth,Relevance 
Compare Performance:
Compare the collected data to identify differences in performance across platforms.
Identify any platform-specific advantages, such as faster response times, more accurate answers, or more intuitive interfaces.
Deliverables:
A comparison table outlining the performance of each platform (ChatGPT, Claude, Bard, Cohere Command, and Meta) based on accuracy, clarity, depth, and relevance of responses.
A final report summarizing the findings of the experiment, including recommendations on the most suitable AI platform for different use cases based on performance and user
